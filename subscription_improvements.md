# Subscription Functionality Improvements

This document explains the subscription functionality improvements that have been made to enhance the Room Rental System.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CheckSubscription Middleware

A new `CheckSubscription` middleware was implemented to properly enforce subscription rules:

- Ensures only landlords with active subscriptions can access protected routes
- Checks if subscription has expired based on end_date (even if status is still 'active')
- Enforces property and room limits based on the subscription plan
- Provides specific error messages to guide users
- Logs subscription validation failures for monitoring
- Redirects users to subscription plans page when needed

### 2. Enhanced User Model

The User model was improved with better subscription-related methods:

- Updated `activeSubscription()` to check both status and end_date
- Added `hasReachedPropertyLimit()` and `hasReachedRoomLimit()` methods to validate against plan limits
- Improved code organization and readability

### 3. Added Query Scopes to UserSubscription Model

New query scopes were added to make subscription queries more readable and efficient:

- `scopeActive()` - finds truly active subscriptions (not expired)
- `scopeExpired()` - finds expired subscriptions
- `scopeTrial()` - finds trial subscriptions
- `scopeWithStatus()` - filters by status
- `scopeExpiringWithin()` - finds subscriptions expiring in the next X days

### 4. Updated Controllers to Respect Subscription Limits

The property and room controllers were updated to check subscription limits:

- PropertyController now checks property limits before creating new properties
- RoomController now checks room limits before creating new rooms
- Both controllers provide clear error messages when limits are reached

### 5. Added Tests

Created tests to verify the subscription functionality works correctly:

- Test to verify property limits are enforced
- Test to verify access is restricted with expired subscriptions

## How It Works

1. When a landlord tries to access a protected route, the `CheckSubscription` middleware validates:
   - If they have an active subscription
   - If the subscription has expired
   - If they're trying to create resources, it checks against plan limits

2. Controllers perform additional checks before creating resources to enforce limits

3. Clear error messages guide users to upgrade their subscription when needed

## Recommendation for Future Improvements

1. **Dashboard Notifications**: Add a dashboard widget showing subscription status and limits usage

2. **Email Notifications**: Send automatic emails when:
   - Subscription is about to expire (7 days, 3 days, 1 day)
   - Subscription has expired
   - Resource limits are nearly reached (80%, 90%)

3. **Usage Analytics**: Add a page showing resource usage over time

4. **Auto-renewal**: Implement automatic subscription renewal with payment integration

5. **Grace Period**: Add a configurable grace period after expiration before restricting access
